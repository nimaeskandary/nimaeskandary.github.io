## What I'm doing currently

Computer Science Major at Drexel University, class of 2019. Currently work part-time at Comcast, as a core contributor to [VinylDNS](https://vinyldns.io).

## Past experience

Have been rotating between part-time and full-time roles at Comcast since September 2016, through Drexel's co-op program. Most of this time was with the VinylDNS team in a department that develops, deploys, and operates distributed platforms as a service for other Comcast engineers. 

Six months of my time was spent rotating through the Comcast Labs department, engineering proof of concept software that utilized IoT, blockchain, sentiment analysis, and X1 technologies.
