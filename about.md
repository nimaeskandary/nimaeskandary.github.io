This blog is hosted on Github Pages and uses the [minma Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/nimaeskandary/nimaeskandary.github.io). I plan to use it to document some experiences with tech and tools as I use them/ whatever else I can think of to post. I've never been a blogger so I may decide this was a dumb idea and will stop posting, time will tell

A short blurb about myself: I'm a Computer Science Major at Drexel University, class of 2019, and have been working at Comcast in various roles since 2016. I put more effort to describing myself on [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nimaeskandary), so won't rewrite most of it here. I do have fun designing and engineering software, and I hope I can maybe embed that in some of my posts
