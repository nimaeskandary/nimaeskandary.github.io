I've never been a blogger before but thought I'd try it out (mostly because I wanted play around with aws)

I will make a future post with more details but this site is hosted on Github Pages, and I use Route 53 and CloudFront for my custom domain

It took a couple hours to set this up, and all the annoying kinks I had to figure out makes me want to end this first post early
